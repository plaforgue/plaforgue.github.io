== About me
I am a third year PhD Candidate in Machine Learning at Télécom Paris, under the supervision of Professors [\/https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/ Florence d'Alché-Buc] and [\/https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/clemenco/ Stephan Clémençon].

I am funded by the industrial chair [\/https://datascienceandai.wp.imt.fr/ Data science & artificial intelligence for digitalized industry & services] held by Professor Florence d'Alché-Buc.\n
I was also recently *awarded a research grant* by the chair [\/https://www.goodintech.org/?lng=en Good in Tech] to study algorithms in presence of selection bias.


Previously, I jointly graduated from [\/https://www.ensae.fr/en/ ENSAE Paris] and [\/https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/MASH/index.html Master M2 MASH] at ENS Cachan and Université Paris-Dauphine.\n
You can find more about my background on my [\/https://fr.linkedin.com/in/pierre-laforgue-201050185 LinkedIn] or in my [\/subfiles/resume.pdf resume].


== Research Interests
My research interests are broadly Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Theory, and include more precisely:
- Kernel Methods, Operator-Valued Kernels, Vector-Valued RKHSs, Structured Prediction
- Robust Learning, Median-of-Means Estimators, Debiasing Methods
